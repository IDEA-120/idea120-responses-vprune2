Murray’s predictions are very close to how our society ingests television and stories today. They can be viewed on a variety of devices that are all linked together and have to ability to show more than one window at a time. Our technology seems to be all merging into one as laptops, phones, and tvs can almost access and do all of the same things. Additionally, storytelling has expanded immensely as tv shows can now be interactive such as the Black Mirror episode which you can choose what happens next in the story. And now with virtual reality and multiplayer games, people can wholly immerse themselves in new fictional worlds and interact with real people in these worlds. This relates to the set of The Mandalorian as the actors are placed into the virtual worlds projected on the LED screens. Now the actors can see the environment their characters are set in rather than having to imagine it and can better understand their characters and the story by seeing it as they create it. They can experience the “reality” of their characters first hand. The viewers get a more realistic view of the fictional world as they discussed how reflections, lighting, and environments would be more accurate.
