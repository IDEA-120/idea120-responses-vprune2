I believe this quote points out the structures of digital media and how information is organized and presented. Each different app or site has its own unique structure and way of presenting information that is shaped by its creator and by the imagined persona of its intended audience. I think in a way we do step into the mental structure of the designers since they shape how we are receiving media and what media we are receiving. We get a view into how they process information. 
I think one very clear example of a specific mental structure portrayed in a media tool is the structure of TikTok. TikTokâ€™s set up of easy scrolling of short, quick videos of all different topics that are neverending is certainly a specific mental structure that is being experienced. Its a mental structure of absorbing as much information as you can while using the app and exploring as many different visuals and stories as you can. Its set up in a way that its easy to continue to see new information and visuals one after the other with no visual breaks or borders. It creates an interesting identity of neverending information and access to any type of media with a swipe or tap of your fingers.
