Some tools I can think of that could create work under the idea of Gesamtkunstwerk are projectors. Projectors could be used to inform a setting in which people could interact with the work or act around it. If different layers of walls or objects appear in the setting of the projector, it can create a 3D effect that can change how the setting is viewed by the audience. The images paired with sound and actors further impacts a personâ€™s viewing experience. Projects offer a physical interaction with a seemingly digital space that offers a new perspective on space and the digital world.
	On work in the Rhizome Anthology that relates to this idea is Natural Process by Exonemo. This work features the image of the google search page painted large scale onto a wall and then reestablished into the digital world via livestream. This work combines physical landscape and painting with digital recording and media to create an interesting sense of digital and physical worlds combining. The interaction the viewers have with the work in the physical space is then transmitted to the livestream where digital viewers are interacting with the work.
