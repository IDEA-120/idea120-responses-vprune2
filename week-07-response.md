The problems Bridle point out are very real and very current. The internet has morphed into something that we can no longer fully control and that is causing harm to the most vulnerable of our society. These examples are simply the most clear and perceivable, but has he mentioned extend to other groups and types of information. Unfathomable amount of content lives on the internet and on Youtube alone which has proven to be impossible to completely monitor and censor. I agree with Bridle when he brings up the fact that these videos are a result of exploitation of the system and vulnerable groups as well as unregulated automation of content. These videos were never truly made with the children’s benefit in mind, rather, videos like these targeted to children are made to accrue millions of views and make a profit.
	I believe Bridle’s vision for the internet is to be a source to learn from, to explore, to discover yourself, and to expand your world view. He envisions that the internet should not include thoughtless, harmful, automatically generated content. I agree with his vision. Although automation seems helpful and makes processes easier, it allows for content to go unsupervised and what we end up with are the examples Bridle has provided such as the videos, the tshirts, and ads. I believe the internet should be more monitored especially for the sake of the children who are growing up with such easy access to it.
